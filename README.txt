This is a little side project I made when I was first starting to learn Python.
It searches through all the programming jobs on Indeed and scrapes their descriptions, mentioned programming language, salaries, and company ratings among other things. It then enters this information into a database, and collects daily metadata about the number of active jobs, mean salaries, most common languages, and the proportion that are permanent/full-time/remote. 

Since I made it for myself, I haven't added a GUI, and it only works on Windows machines that have chrome version 98 or higher installed in the default directory.

The "IndeedScraper.lnk" shortcut has been included to run the program without needing to have a python interpreter with all the dependencies installed.

Running the program will update the "Jobs.sqlite" database that can be viewed with DB Browser for SQLite.

Unfortunately, school has prevented me from making a proper project that would show my current abilities, but I hope that this shows some of my passion for programming. I spent my entire winter break learning Python and using that knowledge in 8 hour long sessions of creating programs like this, all purely because I loved the challenge it brought and the rich problem-solving it required. I bring a insatiable passion for learning towards everything I pursue, and I hope you'll allow me to show you that passion.
