This is a little side project I made when I was first starting to learn Python to help me look for programming jobs.

Since I made it for myself, I haven't added a GUI, and it only works on Windows machines that have chrome version 98 or higher installed in the default directory.

Unfortunately, school has prevented me from making a proper project that would show my current abilities.

The "IndeedScraper.lnk" shortcut has been included to run the program without needing to have a python interpreter with all the dependencies installed.
